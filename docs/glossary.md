Glossary
========

This document provides standard definitions of election and RCV-related
terms for the purposes of this project.  As much as possible, the names
of functions, variables, etc. will be chosen to be consistent with these
definitions.

Note that the statutes of individual jurisdictions may assign different
meanings to these terms.  For this reason, the project strives to maintain
a visual distinction between terms when they are using the global project
meaning and terms and when they are using the meaning as assigned by
the statute being discussed.
